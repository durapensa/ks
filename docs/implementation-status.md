# Implementation Status Tracker

*Last updated: 2025-06-17*

This document tracks the actual implementation status of GitHub issues to prevent disconnect between planned work and delivered functionality.

## Completed Issues (Recommended for Closure)

### âœ… Issue #19 - SQLite Knowledge Graph
**Status**: COMPLETE  
**Implemented**: 
- SQLite schema exactly as specified (`tools/kg/schema.sql`)
- All core tools: `extract-concepts`, `query`, `run-distillation`
- Distillation pipeline with concept/edge/alias tables
- Weight calculation with human/AI attribution

- Core coverage of major tools

**Remaining**:
- Complete coverage of all analysis tools
- Performance benchmarking
- Additional error scenarios
- Logex conversation testing integration

## Partially Complete Issues

### ðŸŸ¡ Issue #18 - Unified Knowledge Graph
**Status**: 60% COMPLETE  
**Implemented**:
- Dual-write system (approved.jsonl + summary)
- Source attribution and provenance tracking
- Rejection learning with feedback storage
- Basic concept distillation pipeline

**Remaining**:
- Advanced concept deduplication with clustering
- Sophisticated weight fusion algorithms
- Temporal evolution tracking
- Cross-reference optimization

### ðŸŸ¡ Issue #11 - Dual Capture Modes
**Status**: 40% COMPLETE  
**Implemented**:
- `ks` command infrastructure supports both modes
- Interactive mode fully functional
- Basic argument parsing foundation

**Remaining**:
- Quick capture mode UX design
- Piped input support
- Clear mode documentation
- Backwards compatibility validation

## Open Issues (No Implementation Yet)

### ðŸ”´ Issue #21 - ksd Debug Mode
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Notes**: ksd was completely rewritten in Go but debug mode features not implemented

### ðŸ”´ Issue #22 - fx Integration in ksd
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Notes**: fx can be launched from ksd but not integrated as primary viewer

### ðŸ”´ Issue #29 - Supervisord Migration
**Status**: PARTIALLY STARTED  
**Notes**: Logex uses supervisord but system-wide migration incomplete

### ðŸ”´ Issue #28 - Complexity Analysis
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Notes**: Codebase has grown significantly, analysis would be valuable

### ðŸ”´ Issue #20 - Claude-Claude Experiments
**Status**: INFRASTRUCTURE READY  
**Notes**: Logex system provides foundation, specific experiments not yet designed

## Milestone Status

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Issue #15**: 80% complete (infrastructure done, coverage gaps remain)
- **Issue #24**: 85% complete (core functionality delivered)  
- **Issue #29**: 20% complete (logex pilot successful)
- **Overall**: Ready for production use

### Knowledge Graph Implementation  
- **Issue #19**: 100% complete (closed)
- **Issue #18**: 60% complete (foundation solid, advanced features pending)
- **Issue #20**: 0% (infrastructure ready via #24)
- **Overall**: Functional foundation, enhancement opportunities

### Dashboard & UI Improvements
- **Issue #11**: 40% complete (infrastructure ready, UX pending)
- **Issue #21**: 0% complete
- **Issue #22**: 0% complete  
- **Overall**: Major rewrite completed, specific features pending

## Development Recommendations

**High Priority**: 
1. Design logex experiments (Issue #20) to inform other development priorities
2. Complete dual capture modes UX (Issue #11) for daily usability
3. Advanced knowledge graph features (Issue #18) for better insight quality

**Medium Priority**:
4. Complete test coverage (Issue #15) for development confidence  
5. Dashboard enhancements (Issues #21, #22) for better monitoring
6. System-wide supervisord migration (Issue #29) for consistency

**Low Priority**:
7. Complexity analysis (Issue #28) for technical debt management
8. Conversation harness polish (Issue #24) based on experiment results

## Update Process

This document should be updated:
- When issues are closed or substantially completed
- When new major features are implemented
- Monthly during development sprints
- Before planning new development phases

The goal is maintaining alignment between GitHub issue tracking and actual system capabilities.
