# Knowledge Graph Implementation Status

*Created: 2025-06-17*  
*Context: Documenting current KG capabilities to inform logex experiment design*

## Overview

The ks knowledge graph implementation is much further advanced than GitHub issues suggest. This document provides an accurate assessment of current capabilities to inform experimental priorities using the logex conversation harness.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Core Infrastructure (Complete)

**SQLite Schema** (`tools/kg/schema.sql`):
- Concepts table with human/AI weight attribution
- Edges table with relationship types and strength
- Aliases table for concept normalization  
- Distillation runs tracking with metadata
- Performance indexes for efficient queries

**Distillation Pipeline** (Functional):
- `tools/kg/extract-concepts` - Extracts concepts from event streams
- `tools/kg/run-distillation` - Orchestrates full distillation process
- `tools/kg/query` - Rich querying with statistics and custom SQL
- Context-aware operation (conversation vs global KG)

**Data Flow** (Working):
```
Raw Events â†’ Concept Extraction â†’ Weight Calculation â†’ Graph Storage â†’ Query Interface
```

### âœ… Event Integration (Complete)

**Multi-Stream Processing**:
- `events/hot.jsonl` - Human thoughts and insights
- `derived/approved.jsonl` - Human-curated AI findings  
- `derived/stream.jsonl` - Claude conversation events
- Automatic source attribution and weight calculation

**Background Analysis Integration**:
- Theme extraction feeds concept identification
- Connection finding informs edge creation
- Pattern analysis strengthens concept weights
- Human review ensures quality control

### ðŸŸ¡ Advanced Features (Partial)

**Currently Working**:
- Basic concept deduplication via name matching
- Simple weight calculation (frequency + recency)
- Human vs AI contribution tracking
- Cross-reference between events and concepts

**Partially Implemented**:
- Alias management (basic functionality)
- Relationship extraction (simple co-occurrence)
- Temporal weight decay (basic algorithm)

**Not Yet Implemented**:
- Advanced concept clustering with embeddings
- Sophisticated edge pruning algorithms
- Complex weight fusion strategies
- Visual graph exploration interface

## Experimental Opportunities

The logex conversation harness provides unique opportunities to test and enhance the knowledge graph system through controlled AI dialogues.

### Recommended Logex Experiments

#### 1. **Concept Formation Dynamics**
**Experiment**: Claude-Claude dialogue on emergence of new concepts
```yaml
# logex config suggestion
conversation:
  topic: "How do new scientific concepts emerge from existing knowledge?"
  participants: [physicist-claude, philosopher-claude]
  rounds: 15
  capture_strategy: "concept-tracking"
```

**KG Learning Objectives**:
- How do new concepts crystallize during dialogue?
- What concept weight evolution patterns emerge?
- How do human vs AI concept formations differ?
- Which concepts prove most "sticky" across conversations?

#### 2. **Relationship Discovery Validation**
**Experiment**: Systematic exploration of concept relationships
```yaml
conversation:
  topic: "Explore connections between complexity science and software architecture"  
  participants: [systems-theorist-claude, software-architect-claude]
  rounds: 20
  analysis_focus: "relationship-mapping"
```

**KG Learning Objectives**:
- Do AI-discovered relationships match human intuitions?
- Which relationship types emerge most frequently?
- How do relationship strengths correlate with dialogue depth?
- Can we predict valuable relationships before they're discussed?

#### 3. **Knowledge Consolidation Patterns**
**Experiment**: Multiple conversations on same topic with different participants
```yaml
# Conversation series
conversations:
  - topic: "Distributed systems consensus"
    participants: [database-expert-claude, network-engineer-claude]
  - topic: "Distributed systems consensus"  
    participants: [mathematician-claude, systems-programmer-claude]
  - topic: "Distributed systems consensus"
    participants: [game-theorist-claude, blockchain-developer-claude]
```

**KG Learning Objectives**:
- How do concept definitions converge across dialogues?
- Which concepts are universal vs domain-specific?
- What deduplication strategies work best?
- How should concept weights evolve with repeated discussion?

#### 4. **Cross-Domain Knowledge Transfer**
**Experiment**: Deliberately bridge different knowledge domains
```yaml
conversation:
  topic: "Apply biological evolution principles to software development"
  participants: [evolutionary-biologist-claude, senior-developer-claude]
  rounds: 25
  capture_focus: "analogical-reasoning"
```

**KG Learning Objectives**:
- How do analogical connections form in the knowledge graph?
- Which cross-domain relationships prove most valuable?
- Can we identify "bridge concepts" that connect domains?
- How do metaphorical vs literal relationships differ in the graph?

### Implementation Priorities Based on Experiments

#### High Priority (Based on Expected Experiment Needs)
1. **Enhanced Relationship Extraction** - Current co-occurrence is too simplistic
2. **Better Concept Clustering** - Need to identify when concepts are actually the same
3. **Temporal Pattern Analysis** - Track how concepts evolve during conversations
4. **Cross-Reference Optimization** - Link KG concepts back to specific dialogue moments

#### Medium Priority (Experiment-Informed)
5. **Advanced Weight Fusion** - Combine human and AI insights more intelligently
6. **Relationship Type Expansion** - Beyond basic 'relates to' categories
7. **Confidence Calibration** - Better scoring for AI-generated insights
8. **Query Interface Enhancement** - Support complex experimental analysis

#### Low Priority (Post-Experiment)
9. **Visual Graph Exploration** - Once we understand what patterns matter
10. **Performance Optimization** - Scale to handle extensive dialogue datasets
11. **Export Capabilities** - Share findings with external tools

## Experimental Infrastructure Ready

The knowledge graph system is **production-ready for logex experiments** with these capabilities:

### Data Collection
- Automated concept extraction from logex conversations
- Real-time weight updates as dialogues progress  
- Full provenance tracking from dialogue turns to KG concepts
- Integration with existing background analysis pipeline

### Analysis Capabilities
- Rich SQL queries for pattern discovery
- Concept relationship exploration
- Temporal evolution tracking
- Human vs AI contribution analysis

### Missing for Experiments
- **Advanced clustering algorithms** (needed for concept deduplication)
- **Sophisticated relationship inference** (beyond simple co-occurrence)
- **Experimental analysis tools** (specialized queries for dialogue experiments)

## Recommendation

**Proceed with logex experiments immediately** - the current KG implementation provides sufficient foundation for meaningful experiments. Use experiment results to prioritize the advanced features listed above.

The knowledge graph system is ready to capture and analyze the insights from Claude-Claude dialogues, providing data to drive the next phase of development priorities.

## Next Steps

1. **Design specific logex experiments** targeting KG research questions
2. **Run pilot conversations** to test KG capture during dialogues  
3. **Analyze results** to identify highest-value KG enhancements
4. **Prioritize development** based on experimental insights rather than theoretical features

The combination of working logex infrastructure + functional knowledge graph creates a unique research platform for understanding AI knowledge formation and transfer.
