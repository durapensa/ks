# ksd TUI Implementation - Outstanding Work

*Document updated: 2025-06-17*
*Status: Core implementation complete, enhancements pending*

## Overview

The Go-based ksd TUI has been successfully implemented and deployed, replacing the legacy bash version. This document tracks remaining technical debt and planned enhancements.

## Technical Debt and Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **Process monitoring uses placeholder data** - Background registry not yet implemented
- **Capture screen is placeholder** - Interactive event capture form implementation pending
- **Search limited to 10 results display** - No pagination or filtering beyond basic search
- **No persistent user preferences** - Settings reset on each session
- **File watching not implemented** - Dashboard updates on timer only, not real-time file changes

### Planned Improvements
- **Implement real background process monitoring** - Connect to actual process registry
- **Add interactive event capture form** - Replace placeholder with functional input
- **Enhanced search with filtering and pagination** - Support for large result sets
- **Configuration file support for user preferences** - Persistent TUI settings
- **Live file watching with fsnotify** - Real-time updates instead of polling

## Future Development

### Phase 2 Enhancements (Planned)
- **Live File Watching**: fsnotify-based real-time updates when events are added
- **Split Pane Support**: Multi-view workflows for simultaneous operations
- **Enhanced Charts**: Sparklines for event trends and analysis patterns
- **Custom Themes**: User-configurable color schemes and styling

### Advanced Features (Future)
- **Keyboard Macros**: Recordable action sequences for common workflows
- **Configuration Files**: Persistent TUI preferences and custom layouts
- **Plugin System**: Extensible screen types for specialized workflows
- **Network Monitoring**: Remote knowledge system support and synchronization

## Implementation Priorities

### High Priority
1. **Real background process monitoring** - Essential for accurate status display
2. **Live file watching** - Improve user experience with real-time updates
3. **Interactive event capture** - Complete the capture workflow within TUI

### Medium Priority
4. **Enhanced search capabilities** - Better knowledge exploration
5. **User preference persistence** - Improved daily usage experience

### Low Priority
6. **Advanced visualization features** - Charts, themes, macros
7. **Plugin architecture** - Extensibility for future needs

This document focuses on uncompleted work and future enhancements for the ksd TUI system.
