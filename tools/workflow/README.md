# Workflow Tools

This directory contains interactive tools that users run directly as part of their knowledge system workflow.

## Tools

- `review-findings` - Interactive review of analysis findings from background processes

## Usage

These tools are designed for direct user interaction, unlike the automated analysis tools in `tools/analyze/`.

Run tools from the project root:
```bash
tools/workflow/review-findings
```
