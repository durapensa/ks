# Development Status

**Last Updated**: June 10, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Implementing unified knowledge graph foundation (Issue #18)

## Current Focus

### 1. Unified Knowledge Graph Implementation (Issue #18)
**Status**: Phase 1 complete!
**Completed**:
- Implemented stream.jsonl separation for Claude conversation captures
- Added [Claude] prefix detection in events tool
- Fixed timestamp field consistency (ts everywhere)
- Implemented dual-write system in review-findings:
  - Summary writes to hot.jsonl with derived_ref
  - Full findings write to derived/approved.jsonl with enriched metadata
  - Bidirectional linking via unique derived_ref IDs
- Added enriched metadata tracking:
  - Analysis type, model, completion time, approval time
  - Unique ID format: timestamp-analysis_type-index
- Implemented rejected findings storage:
  - Stores to derived/rejected.jsonl
  - Captures rejection reason and improvement notes
  - Supports learning from rejected patterns

**Phase 2** (Issue #19):
- Implement SQLite-based distilled knowledge graph
- Build distillation and curation tools
- Create minimal schema with concepts, edges, and aliases tables

**Experimental** (Issue #20):
- Claude-Claude dialogue framework for discovering conceptual attractors
- Potential validation of mechanistic interpretability findings

### 2. Test Suite Stabilization (Issue #15)
**Status**: Phase 1 complete - all fast tests passing (23/23)
**Next**: Fix remaining mocked tests (12/19 passing)
- Find-connections tests need mock response updates
- Implement E2E response caching to reduce API costs

### 2. Complete Background Analysis Tools (Issue #16)
**Status**: Theme analysis functional, 2 tools remaining
**Missing Tools**:
- `tools/analyze/surface-deep-connections` - Find non-obvious connections
- `tools/analyze/synthesize-emergent-insights` - Generate higher-level insights
**Pattern**: Pure analysis functions outputting structured JSON

### 3. Validate Event-Driven System
**Status**: Implemented but needs real-world testing
**Validation Tasks**:
- Capture 10+ events to trigger theme analysis
- Test `tools/workflow/review-findings` workflow
- Verify queue blocking prevents duplicate analyses
- Monitor cost and performance patterns

## Technical Debt & Blockers

### Test Infrastructure
- **Analysis Tool Testing**: No mocked Claude API responses
- **Coverage Gaps**: Security tests partially implemented
- **E2E Testing**: No response caching increases costs

### Performance & Monitoring
- **Missing Benchmarks**: EPOCHSECONDS vs subprocess performance gains unmeasured
- **No Analysis Caching**: Repeated API costs for similar queries
- **Manual Cleanup**: Process records require manual maintenance
- **Health Checks**: Background system lacks automated monitoring

### Documentation & Quality
- **Bash 5.x Requirements**: Not documented in README/setup
- **Code Linting**: No shellcheck integration
- **Performance Metrics**: No observability into analysis success rates

## Development Context

### Commands & Debugging
```bash
# Test execution
./tests/run_fast_tests.sh        # All fast tests (23/23 passing)
./tests/run_ci_tests.sh          # Fast + mocked for CI

# System monitoring  
tools/plumbing/monitor-background-processes --status
cat knowledge/.background/analysis_queue.json
cat knowledge/.background/.event_trigger_state

# Manual triggers
tools/plumbing/check-event-triggers verbose
tools/workflow/review-findings     # In separate terminal
```

### Key File Locations
- **Library Modules**: `lib/` (core, events, files) and `tools/lib/` (claude, queue, process)
- **Process State**: `knowledge/.background/state`
- **Test Fixtures**: `tests/mocked/fixtures/`
- **Configuration**: `.ks-env` with centralized environment

### Development Patterns
- **Library Loading**: Direct sourcing (`source "$KS_ROOT/lib/core.sh"`)
- **Analysis Tools**: Pure functions outputting JSON, called by background scheduler
- **Process Management**: JSON-based state tracking with file locking
- **Event Triggers**: Automatic after capture, configurable thresholds

## Active Issues

**Critical**:
- **Issue #15**: Test suite stabilization (Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 in progress)
- **Issue #18**: Unified knowledge graph (Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 planned)

**In Progress**:  
- **Issue #16**: Background analysis tools (1/3 complete)
- **Issue #3**: Background scheduler stability testing

**Ready to Start**:
- **Issue #19**: SQLite-based distilled knowledge graph implementation
- **Issue #20**: Claude-Claude dialogue experiment
- **Issue #10**: Derived knowledge pipeline (architecture ready)
- **Issue #11**: Interactive mode enhancements (quick capture, tags)

**Deferred**:
- **Issue #14**: Performance optimization (current performance acceptable)

## Development Workflow Integration

**Implementation Planning**: Document complete plans in this file when starting features
**Session Management**: Update status after significant progress
**Issue Tracking**: Reference issue numbers in commits, close with `gh issue close`
**Code Quality**: Run tests before commits, verify clean working directory

**System Status**: Event-driven background analysis functional. Library modularization complete. Fast test suite fully passing - development iteration now safe.
