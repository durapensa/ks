# Development Status & Next Steps

**Last Updated**: June 9, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Background processing functional, ready for automation and testing

## Major Recent Accomplishments

### âœ… Background Processing System (Functional and Tested)
- **Process Management**: Full registry with active/completed/failed tracking
- **Real Claude Integration**: schedule-analysis-cycles uses `claude -p` with 120s timeouts  
- **Universal Notifications**: All tools display background results automatically
- **KG Curation**: Similarity-based duplicate prevention (curate-duplicate-knowledge)
- **Cost Controls**: Daily budget tracking and cost-controlled analysis scopes
- **File Locking**: Strict serialization prevents concurrent background processes

### âœ… Infrastructure Improvements  
- **tools/plumbing/**: New system infrastructure category (renamed from process/)
- **Process Monitoring**: monitor-background-processes for comprehensive management
- **Archive Management**: cleanup-stale-notifications with configurable retention
- **Enhanced .ks-env**: Process management and notification functions

## Immediate Priorities

### High Impact, Ready for Implementation
1. **Automated Background Scheduling** (Issue #3 completion)
   - Add cron/launchd integration to schedule-analysis-cycles
   - Currently manual trigger, need daemon mode

2. **Connection Analysis Implementation** 
   - Extend background system beyond theme analysis
   - Add connection-specific claude -p prompts

3. **Test Suite Foundation** (Issue #15)
   - Fast tests for shared functions (ks_collect_files, process management)
   - Mocked claude -p testing framework

### Medium Priority (Architecture)
4. **Error Recovery Enhancement**
   - Retry logic for failed Claude calls with exponential backoff
   - Comprehensive error logging and alerting

5. **Configuration Management**
   - User controls for background processing frequency
   - Configurable similarity thresholds and cost budgets

6. **Derived Knowledge Pipeline** (Issue #10)
   - Populate knowledge/derived/ with background analysis results
   - Structured concept and insight persistence

## Current Technical Debt

### High Priority (Performance)
- **Python Migration Incomplete** (Issue #14 Phase 1): Still using bash/jq for core processing
- **No Analysis Caching**: Background results not cached, repeated API costs
- **Limited Concurrency**: Strict serialization prevents parallel processing

### Medium Priority (Monitoring)
- **No Health Checks**: Background system lacks automated monitoring
- **Missing Metrics**: No observability into analysis success rates
- **Process Cleanup**: Manual cleanup of old process records

## Development Workflow

### Recommended Next Session
1. **Automated Scheduling**: Add daemon mode to schedule-analysis-cycles
2. **Connection Analysis**: Implement second analysis type for background system  
3. **Test Framework**: Begin with fast tests for process management functions

### Current Development Environment
- **Background Processing**: `tools/plumbing/schedule-analysis-cycles --force` for testing
- **Process Monitoring**: `tools/plumbing/monitor-background-processes --status`
- **Architecture**: Background system uses `knowledge/.background/` for state/logs

## Active Issues Status

- **Issue #5**: Notification system - âœ… COMPLETED and closed
- **Issue #3**: Background scheduler - ðŸŸ¡ FUNCTIONAL, needs automation
- **Issue #14**: Performance optimization - ðŸŸ¡ Phase 1 partially complete
- **Issue #15**: Test suite design - ðŸ”´ CRITICAL for ongoing development
- **Issue #10**: Derived knowledge pipeline - ðŸŸ¡ Ready for implementation
