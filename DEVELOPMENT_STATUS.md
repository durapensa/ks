# Development Status & Next Steps

**Last Updated**: June 9, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Post-optimization, ready for reliability improvements

## Immediate Priorities

### High Impact, Quick Implementation (30-60 minutes each)
1. **Timeout protection** for `ks_claude()` wrapper
   ```bash
   # Add to .ks-env ks_claude function
   timeout 120 claude "$@"
   ```

2. **Progress indicators** for long-running operations
   ```bash
   echo "Analyzing with Claude..." >&2
   result=$(ks_claude "$@") 
   echo "Analysis complete." >&2
   ```

3. **File locking** in `ks_collect_files()` to prevent race conditions

### Medium Priority (1-2 hours each)
4. **JSONL validation** before expensive Claude API calls
5. **Retry logic** for Claude API failures
6. **Comprehensive help** messages for all tools

### Foundation Work (Multiple sessions)
7. **Test suite implementation** (Issue #15) - critical for quality
8. **Analysis result caching** - avoid repeated expensive API calls
9. **Monitoring infrastructure** - metrics and observability

## Current Technical Debt

### High Priority (Affects Reliability)
- No timeout protection for Claude API calls - tools can hang indefinitely
- Missing comprehensive test coverage - changes risk regressions
- No file locking - race conditions possible during concurrent operations

### Medium Priority (Affects UX)
- No caching for expensive operations - repeated API costs
- Limited error recovery mechanisms - failures aren't graceful
- Missing progress feedback - users uncertain if tools are working

## Development Workflow

### Recommended Session Approach
1. **Quick wins first**: Implement timeout protection and progress indicators
2. **Test foundation**: Begin with fast tests for shared functions (Issue #15)
3. **User experience**: Add comprehensive help and better error messages
4. **Performance**: Implement caching and advanced optimizations

### Current Development Environment
- **Setup**: Run `./setup.sh` to ensure GNU tools are properly configured
- **Testing**: Manual testing with real knowledge data in `knowledge/events/`
- **Architecture**: Optimized tools use shared functions in `.ks-env`

## Active Issues Status

- **Issue #15**: Test suite design - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION (Phase 1: fast tests)
- **Issue #14**: Performance optimization - Phase 1 complete, timeout protection needed
- **Issue #1**: Test harness for conversation workflows - superseded by #15
- **Issue #3**: Background analysis scheduler - medium priority
- **Issue #5**: Notification system implementation - medium priority

**System is stable and optimized, ready for reliability and UX improvements.**
