# Development Status & Next Steps

**Last Updated**: June 9, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Background processing functional and tested - prioritized roadmap established for next development phase

## Major Recent Accomplishments

### âœ… Background Processing System (Functional and Tested)
- **Process Management**: Full registry with active/completed/failed tracking
- **Real Claude Integration**: schedule-analysis-cycles uses `claude -p` with 120s timeouts  
- **Universal Notifications**: All tools display background results automatically
- **KG Curation**: Similarity-based duplicate prevention (curate-duplicate-knowledge)
- **Cost Controls**: Daily budget tracking and cost-controlled analysis scopes
- **File Locking**: Strict serialization prevents concurrent background processes

### âœ… Infrastructure Improvements  
- **tools/plumbing/**: New system infrastructure category (renamed from process/)
- **Process Monitoring**: monitor-background-processes for comprehensive management
- **Archive Management**: cleanup-stale-notifications with configurable retention
- **Enhanced .ks-env**: Process management and notification functions

### Analysis Insights (from Live System Testing)
- **Execution Performance**: ~100 seconds for 15-event analysis batch
- **Architecture Balance**: File-based simplicity with industrial-strength process management
- **Self-Documenting**: Inspectable state files enable easy debugging
- **Test Mode**: Built-in mock notifications for development without API costs

## Prioritized Development Roadmap

### 1. **Test Suite Foundation** (Issue #15) - **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
**Why Critical**: Building on quicksand without tests. The background system's complexity requires automated testing to prevent silent breakage.

**Implementation Plan**:
```bash
# Create tests/ directory structure
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ test_env.sh          # Test .ks-env functions
â”œâ”€â”€ test_process_mgmt.sh # Test process lifecycle
â”œâ”€â”€ test_notifications.sh # Test notification handling
â””â”€â”€ fixtures/            # Mock data and responses
```

**Quick Wins**:
- Test `ks_collect_files` function with various date ranges
- Test process registration/completion/failure flows
- Mock claude API responses to avoid costs
- Verify notification creation and display logic

### 2. **Automated Background Scheduling** (Issue #3) - **HIGH VALUE, LOW EFFORT**
**Why Important**: The system is a Ferrari that requires manual ignition. Automation unlocks continuous value.

**Implementation Approach**:
```bash
# Option 1: Add --daemon mode to schedule-analysis-cycles
while true; do
    ./schedule-analysis-cycles
    sleep 21600  # 6 hours
done

# Option 2: Simple cron entry
*/6 * * * * /path/to/tools/plumbing/schedule-analysis-cycles

# Option 3: macOS launchd plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN"...>
```

### 3. **Connection Analysis Implementation** (Issue #16) - **EXPAND CAPABILITIES**
**Why Valuable**: Infrastructure exists but only one analysis type implemented.

### 4. **Interactive Mode Enhancements** (Issue #11) - **USER EXPERIENCE**
**Why**: Make knowledge capture more fluid and contextual.

**Implementation in schedule-analysis-cycles**:
```bash
run_connection_analysis() {
    local events_file="$1"
    prompt="Analyze these knowledge entries for deep, non-obvious connections..."
    # Reuse existing infrastructure
    run_claude_analysis "$events_file" "$prompt" "connection"
}

case "$analysis_type" in
    theme) run_theme_analysis "$events_file" ;;
    connection) run_connection_analysis "$events_file" ;;
    insight) run_insight_analysis "$events_file" ;;  # Future
esac
```

### 5. **Derived Knowledge Pipeline** (Issue #10) - **KNOWLEDGE SYNTHESIS**
**Why**: Background analysis generates insights but doesn't persist them structurally.

**Features to Add**:
- Quick capture: `ks -q "thought"` (bypass chat mode)
- Tag support: `ks -t work,idea "thought"`
- Context preservation between captures
- Session summaries on exit

**Implementation for Derived Knowledge**:
- Create `knowledge/derived/themes/`, `/connections/`, `/insights/`
- Background processes write structured JSON outputs
- Enable queries across derived knowledge
- Version control for concept evolution

## Immediate Action Items (Next Session)

### If Prioritizing Safety and Quality:
1. **Start with Test Suite** (Issue #15)
   - Create `tests/test_env.sh`
   - Test critical functions: `ks_collect_files`, `ks_register_background_process`
   - Add GitHub Actions workflow for CI

### If Prioritizing User Value:
1. **Implement Automated Scheduling** (Issue #3)
   - Add `--daemon` flag to schedule-analysis-cycles
   - Create launchd plist for macOS
   - Document setup process

### If Prioritizing Feature Expansion:
1. **Implement Connection Analysis** (Issue #16)
   - Add new analysis type to schedule-analysis-cycles
   - Create connection-specific prompts
   - Test with existing notification system

## Current Technical Debt

### High Priority (Performance)
- **Performance Optimization Pending** (Issue #14): Bash/jq processing shows strain at scale; Go rewrite planned when needed
- **No Analysis Caching**: Background results not cached, repeated API costs
- **Limited Concurrency**: Strict serialization prevents parallel processing

### Medium Priority (Monitoring)
- **No Health Checks**: Background system lacks automated monitoring
- **Missing Metrics**: No observability into analysis success rates
- **Process Cleanup**: Manual cleanup of old process records

## Development Workflow

### Practical Usage Recommendations (from Analysis)
1. **Start Conservative**: Set higher thresholds initially (10+ events, 12+ hours) to avoid notification overload
2. **Monitor Costs**: Check `knowledge/.background/state` for actual spending patterns
3. **Manual Testing**: Use `--force` flag for on-demand analysis during development
4. **Quality Iteration**: Consider adding relevance scoring to prioritize notifications

### Current Development Environment
- **Background Processing**: `tools/plumbing/schedule-analysis-cycles --force` for testing
- **Process Monitoring**: `tools/plumbing/monitor-background-processes --status`
- **Architecture**: Background system uses `knowledge/.background/` for state/logs
- **State Inspection**: `cat knowledge/.background/state` to see current status

## Active Issues Status

- **Issue #5**: Notification system - âœ… COMPLETED and closed
- **Issue #3**: Background scheduler - ðŸŸ¡ FUNCTIONAL with comprehensive analysis, needs automation only
- **Issue #14**: Performance optimization - ðŸŸ¡ Phase 1 partially complete
- **Issue #15**: Test suite design - ðŸ”´ CRITICAL for ongoing development
- **Issue #10**: Derived knowledge pipeline - ðŸŸ¡ Ready for implementation

**System Status**: Background processing functional with industrial-strength process management in a file-based architecture.

**Next Priority**: Test suite foundation (Issue #15) to ensure safe iteration, followed by automated scheduling (Issue #3) for immediate user value. Clear implementation roadmap established for systematic enhancement of the knowledge system.**
