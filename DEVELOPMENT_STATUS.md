# Development Status & Next Steps

**Last Updated**: June 10, 2025  
**Current Phase**: Claude analysis modularization with brevity constraints

## Major Recent Accomplishments

### Analysis Tool Modularization (June 10, 2025)
- **Modular Functions**: Added `ks_claude_analyze()` and `ks_format_analysis()` to `.ks-lib`
- **Brevity Constraints**: Implemented prompt templates with character limits (50 chars for descriptions, 20-30 for concepts)
- **Code Reduction**: Reduced analysis tool code by ~80% (from ~25 lines to 3-4 lines per tool)
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Centralized JSON validation and error reporting
- **Output Formats**: Unified formatting across json/markdown/text outputs
- **Tools Refactored**: extract-themes, find-connections, identify-recurring-thought-patterns

**Key Benefits**:
- Concise Claude outputs preventing verbose responses
- Easy to tune output length centrally via prompt templates
- Consistent behavior across all analysis tools
- Simplified maintenance and testing

### Background Processing System (Functional, needs extended testing)
- **Process Management**: Full registry with active/completed/failed tracking
- **Real Claude Integration**: Analysis tools use claude with timeouts  
- **Async operation**: Fixed - processes now run truly in background
- **Universal Notifications**: All tools display background results automatically
- **KG Curation**: Similarity-based duplicate prevention (curate-duplicate-knowledge)
- **Cost Controls**: Daily budget tracking and cost-controlled analysis scopes
- **File Locking**: Strict serialization prevents concurrent background processes

### ✅ Infrastructure Improvements  
- **tools/plumbing/**: New system infrastructure category (renamed from process/)
- **Process Monitoring**: monitor-background-processes for comprehensive management
- **Archive Management**: cleanup-stale-notifications with configurable retention
- **Enhanced .ks-env**: Process management and notification functions

### Analysis Insights (from Live System Testing)
- **Execution Performance**: ~100 seconds for 15-event analysis batch
- **Architecture Balance**: File-based simplicity with industrial-strength process management
- **Self-Documenting**: Inspectable state files enable easy debugging
- **Test Mode**: Built-in mock notifications for development without API costs

## Prioritized Development Roadmap

### 1. **Test Suite Foundation** (Issue #15) - **Phase 1 Complete**
**Why Critical**: Building on quicksand without tests. The background system's complexity requires automated testing to prevent silent breakage.

**Implementation Status**:
✅ **Phase 1 Complete**:
- Installed bats-core testing framework with setup script
- Created three-tier test architecture: fast/mocked/e2e
- Implemented 9 passing unit tests for .ks-env functions
- Added integration tests for capture and process tools
- Created security tests for input validation
- Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
- Built test fixtures and mock data

**Test Results**:
- Unit tests: 9/9 passing ✅
- Integration tests: Need tool updates (query tool works)
- Security tests: Partial pass, some functions missing
- Mocked tests: Simple patterns validated

**Planned Directory Structure**:
```bash
tests/
├── run_fast_tests.sh      # No Claude API, <30s, CI-friendly
├── run_mocked_tests.sh    # Fake Claude API, <60s, CI-friendly
├── run_e2e_tests.sh       # Real Claude API, local only
├── run_ci_tests.sh        # Fast + mocked for GitHub Actions
├── fast/                  # Unit and integration tests
│   ├── unit/              # Function-level tests
│   ├── integration/       # Tool integration tests
│   └── security/          # Input validation tests
├── mocked/                # Claude API mocked tests

├── e2e/                   # End-to-end with real Claude
└── performance/           # Benchmark tests
```

**Implementation Plan**:
1. **Phase 1**: Fast test foundation (bats-core setup, unit tests)
2. **Phase 2**: Mocked analysis tests (Claude response fixtures)
3. **Phase 3**: Smart E2E testing (cached responses, minimal datasets)

**Key Design Decisions**:
- No Claude API calls in CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Mock `ks_claude()` function for predictable testing
- Minimal test datasets (5-10 events) for fast execution
- Response caching for development iteration

**Phase 2 Next Steps**:
- Fix failing integration tests by updating tool implementations
- Create wrapper script for mocking ks_claude in actual tools
- Add more comprehensive mocked tests for analysis tools
- Implement response caching system for E2E tests
- Test GitHub Actions workflow with a PR

### 2. **Event-Driven Background Analysis** - **Implemented**
**Major Architecture Change**: Replaced time-based scheduling with event-driven triggers

**New Components**:
- **Event Trigger System**: `tools/plumbing/check-event-triggers`
  - Automatically spawns analyses based on event count thresholds
  - Called after each event capture
  - Configurable thresholds (default: 10 events for themes, 20 for connections)

- **Analysis Queue**: JSON-based queue prevents duplicate analyses
  - Tracks pending reviews
  - Blocks new analyses until user reviews findings

- **Interactive Review Tool**: `tools/analyze/review-findings`
  - Run in separate terminal as instructed
  - Shows each finding individually
  - Y/N approval creates new events from approved findings
  - Clears queue after review

**Deprecated**: `schedule-analysis-cycles --install-launchd` (time-based approach)

### 3. **Async Background Processing** - **Fixed**
**What was wrong**: Background processing blocked with `wait $claude_pid`

**What was fixed**:
- Removed blocking wait calls
- Process runs truly async now
- Verified with testing - returns immediately while analysis continues
- Process registry tracks completion properly

### 4. **Background Analysis Tools** (Issue #16) - **In progress**
**Architecture refactoring completed**:
- Separated analysis logic from process management
- Created `identify-recurring-thought-patterns` for theme analysis
- Schedule-analysis-cycles now calls external tools

**Remaining tools to implement**:
1. `surface-deep-connections` - Find non-obvious connections
2. `synthesize-emergent-insights` - Generate higher-level insights

**Pattern established**:
- Short names (e.g., `extract-themes`) for interactive use
- Long names (e.g., `identify-recurring-thought-patterns`) for background processing

### 5. **Interactive Mode Enhancements** (Issue #11) - **USER EXPERIENCE**
**Why**: Make knowledge capture more fluid and contextual.

### 5. **Derived Knowledge Pipeline** (Issue #10) - **KNOWLEDGE SYNTHESIS**
**Why**: Background analysis generates insights but doesn't persist them structurally.

**Features to Add**:
- Quick capture: `ks -q "thought"` (bypass chat mode)
- Tag support: `ks -t work,idea "thought"`
- Context preservation between captures
- Session summaries on exit

**Implementation for Derived Knowledge**:
- Create `knowledge/derived/themes/`, `/connections/`, `/insights/`
- Background processes write structured JSON outputs
- Enable queries across derived knowledge
- Version control for concept evolution

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. **Test Event-Driven System**
**Validation needed**:
- Capture 10+ events to trigger theme analysis
- Run `tools/analyze/review-findings` when notified
- Verify approved findings create new events
- Check queue blocking prevents duplicate analyses

### 2. **Complete Background Analysis Tools** (Issue #16)
**Implementation tasks**:
1. Create `tools/analyze/surface-deep-connections`
   - Pure analysis function like `identify-recurring-thought-patterns`
   - Find non-obvious connections between knowledge entries
   - Output JSON with discovered connections

2. Create `tools/analyze/synthesize-emergent-insights`
   - Combine outputs from theme and connection analysis
   - Generate higher-level conceptual insights
   - Output structured insights in JSON

3. Update `schedule-analysis-cycles` to call new tools
   - Add connection and insight analysis cases
   - Test each analysis type independently

### 3. **Begin Test Suite** (Issue #15)
**Foundation needed**:
- Test the refactored analysis architecture
- Mock claude responses to avoid API costs
- Verify async process management works correctly

## Current Technical Debt

### Cost Optimization
- **No Analysis Caching**: Background results not cached, repeated API costs for similar queries

### System Monitoring
- **No Health Checks**: Background system lacks automated monitoring
- **Missing Metrics**: No observability into analysis success rates
- **Process Cleanup**: Manual cleanup of old process records

### Deferred Optimizations (Issue #14)
- **Performance**: Bash/jq processing sufficient for current scale; Go rewrite planned if bottlenecks emerge
- **Concurrency**: Single-process model works well for personal knowledge system scale

## Development Workflow

### Practical Usage Recommendations (from Analysis)
1. **Start Conservative**: Set higher thresholds initially (10+ events, 12+ hours) to avoid notification overload
2. **Monitor Costs**: Check `knowledge/.background/state` for actual spending patterns
3. **Manual Testing**: Use `--force` flag for on-demand analysis during development
4. **Quality Iteration**: Consider adding relevance scoring to prioritize notifications

### Current Development Environment
- **Event Triggers**: Automatic after each `tools/capture/events` call
- **Review Findings**: `tools/analyze/review-findings` in separate terminal
- **Queue Status**: `cat knowledge/.background/analysis_queue.json`
- **Trigger State**: `cat knowledge/.background/.event_trigger_state`
- **Manual Trigger**: `tools/plumbing/check-event-triggers verbose`
- **Process Monitoring**: `tools/plumbing/monitor-background-processes --status`

## Active Issues Status

**Completed**:
- **Issue #5**: Notification system - Closed

**In Testing**:
- **Issue #3**: Background scheduler - Daemon implemented, needs multi-day stability test

**In Progress**:
- **Issue #16**: Background analysis tools - Theme analysis done, 2 tools remaining

**Ready to Start**:
- **Issue #15**: Test suite - Critical for safe development
- **Issue #10**: Derived knowledge pipeline - Architecture ready
- **Issue #11**: Interactive mode enhancements - Design complete

**Deferred**:
- **Issue #14**: Performance optimization - Current performance acceptable

---

**System Status**: Background processing now runs asynchronously. Architecture properly separates analysis logic from process management. Daemon scheduling implemented but needs multi-day testing.

**Today's Progress**: 
- Fixed async processing - background tasks run without blocking
- Refactored architecture - clean separation of analysis and process management
- Added daemon mode and launchd support for scheduling
- Created pattern for background analysis tools

**Next Session Priority**: Monitor daemon for stability, then implement remaining analysis tools.
